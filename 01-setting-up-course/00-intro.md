# Intro to Instructional Staff Training

## Work in Progress
The Topics and Lessons in the Instructional Staff Unit were originally designed as part of a workshop where pairs of instructors each worked with their own repos. As such, you will find some of the instructions are a bit outdated.

In particular, this first topic **Setting Up Course** is for review only, and instructors should not complete the exercises. Learn Admins (members of the curriculum team) are responsible for creating courses. Instructional staff do not have the Learn authorization to create courses. 

For the remainder of the Topics and Lessons in the Instructional Staff Unit, you should clone the [Learning Learn Sandbox repo](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/ada-learning-learn-sandbox) and use it to experiment with creating content in Learn.
