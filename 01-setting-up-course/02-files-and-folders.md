# Setting up Files & Folders

Each Cohort/Course in Learn is made up of sections, each section is a repository in Github.

Today we are just going to set up one section, since they're mostly all alike.  Each Section has several units which are collections of markdown, and other documents like PDF, or Jupyter Notebook (READ ONLY).

## Folders

You can create units with a collection of folders in your github repository.  It's a good idea to number the folders in the sequence you want students to tackle them.

## Files

You can create markdown, PDF and even Jupyter Notebook files which contain each lesson in a unit.  Learn supports regular Github markdown, with it's own styling.

So files in Github:

In learn look like:

## Exercise

With your pair create 2-3  folders on any sample topic you want.  Within each folder create a couple of markdown files and fill them with a header on a topic of your choice.
