# Learn Markdown

Learn markdown is much like Github Markdown.  However there are some extra markdown items that Learn provides.

You can see a list of special markdown blocks Learn can handle by typing `learn markdown`, in the terminal.

## Callouts

You can generate callouts by using the following code.  You can generate a template for a callout by using the Learn Cli tool and typing 

```txt
<!-- available callout types: info, success, warning, danger, secondary  -->
### !callout-info

## title
body

### !end-callout
```

## Learn Questions

Learn can also make the following questions such as:

* multiplechoice
* checkbox
* shortanswer
* number
* paragraph
* javascript
* java
* python
* sql
* customsnippet
* project
* testableproject

The multiplechoice, checkbox, shortanswer, number and many programming exercises can be automatically graded, while others require an instructor to review them.  

## Exercise

With your partner create a couple of Questions in your markdown documents.  Then publish the material on Learn and view them in the LMS.
